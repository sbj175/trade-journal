# RIVN Trade Recognition Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Date Offset Issue (May 19→20, May 29→30)
- **Problem**: Dates were showing one day earlier than actual
- **Cause**: Timezone conversion issue - Tastytrade API returns UTC timestamps
- **Fix**: Added timezone handling to convert all timestamps to US/Eastern time before extracting dates

### 2. Multiple Trades Instead of One
- **Problem**: RIVN vertical spread was showing as 3 separate trades instead of 1
- **Cause**: Closing transactions weren't being grouped with their opening transactions
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote the transaction grouping algorithm:
  - Now indexes all opening transactions by option details
  - When finding closing transactions, matches them to their corresponding openings
  - Groups all related legs together regardless of time gaps

## Code Changes in `src/models/trade_strategy.py`

1. **Added timezone support**:
   - Import `pytz` 
   - Convert all timestamps to US/Eastern time
   - Use timezone-aware dates throughout

2. **New `_get_transaction_date()` method**:
   - Centralizes date extraction with proper timezone handling
   - Ensures consistent date representation

3. **Rewritten `_group_related_transactions()` method**:
   - Smarter algorithm that matches closing transactions to openings
   - Handles multi-leg strategies properly
   - Groups all parts of a trade together

4. **Updated date handling in**:
   - `_create_trade_from_transactions()` - entry date
   - Exit date calculation for closed trades

## Result
- RIVN vertical spread now shows as ONE closed trade
- Dates display correctly (May 20 open, May 30 close)
- Proper P&L calculation for the closed spread

## To Apply
1. Restart your app if it's running
2. Click "Sync Trades" to re-process with the fixes
3. RIVN should now appear correctly as a single closed vertical spread
